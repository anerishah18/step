      <p> Today We found out that California is going to be shut down for at least a month,
          maybe even longer. I'm already trying to come up with new things to try with all
          this extra time at home. I extend my thoughts and prayers for everyone affected 
          by COVID-19, and hope you all stay happy and helathy in this uncertain time.</p>

      <h3> 1/1/2020 </h3>
      <p> Today's the first day of a new year and a new decade. I'm looking forward to great
          things ahead and hope I can get farther on my resolutions than I have in past years.
          I'm sad that the holidays are over but excited to go back to school and dive into
          the new semester.
