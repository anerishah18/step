      <h1>Aneri's Portfolio</h1>
      <p> Hi! I'm Aneri, an EECS major at UC Berkeley and a 2020 STEP Intern at Google.
      I am born and brought up in Fremont, CA, at the heart of the Bay Area and have been passionate about
      math and technology for as long as I can remember. In addition, I love to read fiction, try new
      foods, choreograph dance routines, and go camping (the picture below is from a New Years' camping trip).</p>
      <p>At Cal, I am involved with several student organizations include SWE (Society of Women Engineers),
      CSM (Computer Science Mentors), and UC Berkeley Raas Ramzat (a competitive Indian dance team). These
      organizations encapsulate what I am passionate about outside academic pursuits directly tied to my
      degree, including teaching, community activities, and dance. Keep scrolling to learn more about me,
      my favorite things, and everything else that make me me!</p>
