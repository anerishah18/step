      <h3> 3/14/2020 </h3>
      <p> Today We found out that California is going to be shut down for at least a month,
          maybe even longer. I'm already trying to come up with new things to try with all
          this extra time at home. I extend my thoughts and prayers for everyone affected 
          by COVID-19, and hope you all stay happy and helathy in this uncertain time.</p>

      <h3> 1/1/2020 </h3>
      <p> Today's the first day of a new year and a new decade. I'm looking forward to great
          things ahead and hope I can get farther on my resolutions than I have in past years.
          I'm sad that the holidays are over but excited to go back to school and dive into
          the new semester.

      <h3> 1/1/2019 </h3>
      <p> I've officially finished my first semester of college and I couldn't be more 
          thrilled by how it went! I met a lot of new people, tried lots of new foods,
          and joined several clubs including a dance team. My new favorite place to eat is
          Thai Basil right across my dorm and I've found that studying on memorial glade is
          ideal on a sunny spring day.

      <h3> 1/1/2018 </h3>
      <p> I can't believe I'm starting my last semester of high school in a few weeks. I 
          want to make the most of this time and I hope that I don't get caught up in the
          little details and keep track of the bigger picture, especially with college 
          admission letters and graduation coming up.
